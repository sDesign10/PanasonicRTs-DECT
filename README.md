## What to do with original MIDI files

- Load the MIDI with HxD
- Copy all of the hex values in the binary file
- Open the handset's firmware dump with HxD
- Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>F</kbd>
- Click on the <b>Hex-values</b> tab.
- Paste the encoded binary to the search bar, then click on OK.
- Replace the ringtone with a custom MIDI sequence that matches the melody (Mx), ringer (Tx), or alert (Ax) tone.

The custom MIDI sequences are made only for the Dialog SC1444x software synthesizer used in current Panasonic handset models.

üåßÔ∏è DSP Group DCX SoCs are no longer supported. as the firmware flashing or other tools for the SoC are no longer available as of today as a result of the DSPG acquisition by Synaptics.

## For original MIDI files (Vision Inc.):
I own nothing.
The original midi files are both used as a replacement tool for custom ringtones and for your listening pleasure.
All the ringer tones by Vision Inc. (including the European DECT Exclusives) are stored at the "everything" folder.
